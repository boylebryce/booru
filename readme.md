booru - a tag-based image board.

This is a booru that I'm building from scratch to learn about web development and version control. It currently uses PHP and MySQL with some JavaScript thrown in here and there. I'm currently in the process of adding an API to this project to make it work with other applications, such as a Discord bot.
